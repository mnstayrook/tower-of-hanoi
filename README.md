# Title: Tower of Hanoi Exercise
 
_Created by Maegan Stayrook_

Description:
In the MIT MERN Full Stack course, Maegan was given the assignment to modify a Tower of Hanoi file to accomodate any number of disks instead of a maximum cap of 5 disks. Here is the completed assignment.

How to Run:
Type in the number of disks you want; if you do not, it will default to 5. Click the "Make Move" button to start game, and then click again to make the move.

Roadmap:
- Fix: When !DOCUTYPE is put into the HTML file, it breaks the code. Still looking into fix for this.
- Make it more interactive where you have to drag the disks instead of just clicking a button to do it for you.
